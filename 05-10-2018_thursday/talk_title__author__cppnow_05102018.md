If you are seeing this, it means the auhor has not submitted their slides / uploaded their slides! You can:

1. Check to see if the slides are present in this directory (and if they are, then this is a clerical error on the repository's part)
2. If you do not see the slides in this directory, please ask the author for the slides!
