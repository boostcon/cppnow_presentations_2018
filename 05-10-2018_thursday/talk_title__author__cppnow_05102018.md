If you are seeing this, it means the auhor has not submitted their slides / uploaded their slides! You can:

1. Check to see if the slides are present in this directory (and if they are, then this is a clerical error on the repository's part and should be fixed soon -- open an issue request if it hasn't).
2. If you do not see the slides in this directory, please ask the author to send their slides to speaker-files@cppnow.org, or to send them to you directly!
